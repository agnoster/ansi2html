# ansi2html.js [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/agnoster/ansi2html.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/agnoster/ansi2html)


Convert text with ANSI escape sequences to styled HTML.

## Example

```
test[1mBold[32mGreen[31mRed[0mNone
```
    
becomes

```html
test<span style="font-weight:bold">Bold</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:green">Green</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:red">Red</span>None
```

## Usage

In Node.js:

```js
var ansi2html = require('ansi2html')

console.log((new ansi2html("test[1mBold")).render())
```

In the browser:

```js
<pre id="test"></pre>
<script type="text/javascript" src="ansi2html.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
document.getElementById('test').innerHTML = (new ansi2html("test[1mBold")).render()
</script>
```

That's right, ansi2html.js works in Node *and* in the browser, in more or less the same way.

## Supported

* bold
* underline
* foreground & background color
